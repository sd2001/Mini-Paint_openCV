# Mini-Paint_openCV
This is a mini version of Paint, the one which we have been using it in our Windows since the very beginning.Just like we used to draw basic shapes, here all that we can do is drawing rectangles and circles using a toggle button.More interestingly its done using openCV.

Now in openCV,there are 3 solid colour ranges using which different colours can be created.Its denoted in the form of (R,G,B).R stands for Red, G for Green and B for Blue.Now what we do is using trackbars we set different colour ranges and draw the circle or the rectangle.
